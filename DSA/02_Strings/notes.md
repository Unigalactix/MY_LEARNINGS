# Strings â€“ Notes

Key ideas:
- Immutability (Python): creating new strings is O(n)
- Common patterns: sliding window, two pointers, frequency count
- Unicode and normalization can matter; stick to ASCII for practice unless specified

Practice goals:
- Longest substring without repeating chars
- Group anagrams via sorted key or frequency signature
- Palindrome checks (cleaning input, two-pointer)
