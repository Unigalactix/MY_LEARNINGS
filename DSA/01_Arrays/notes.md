# Arrays – Notes

Key ideas:
- Indexable, contiguous; random access O(1)
- Common patterns: prefix sums, two pointers, sliding window, in-place operations
- Pitfalls: off-by-one, mutating while iterating, shallow vs deep copies

Practice goals:
- Master two-sum style hash map approach
- Be fluent with Kadane’s algorithm
- Rotate array in-place (reverse trick)

Complexities:
- Traversal: O(n)
- Insert/delete at end: amortized O(1) (Python list append/pop)
- Insert/delete at front/middle: O(n)
