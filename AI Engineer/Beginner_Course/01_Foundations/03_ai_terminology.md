**Simple Definition**: AI systems that can take actions and make decisions autonomously to achieve goals.

**Analogy**: Like a virtual assistant that can actually do tasks, not just provide information.

**Example**: An AI that can schedule meetings by checking calendars, sending emails, and booking rooms.

**Interview Answer**: "AI agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific objectives."

## Technical Implementation Terms

### 11. API (Application Programming Interface) üîå
**Simple Definition**: A way for different software applications to communicate with each other.

**Analogy**: Like a waiter who takes your order to the kitchen and brings back your food.

**AI Context**: OpenAI API allows developers to access ChatGPT capabilities in their own applications.

**Interview Answer**: "APIs provide standardized interfaces for applications to integrate AI capabilities without building models from scratch."

### 12. Tokens üé´
**Simple Definition**: Units of text that AI models process (roughly equivalent to words or word parts).

**Practical Impact**: Many AI services charge based on token usage.

**Example**: The sentence "Hello world!" might be 3 tokens: ["Hello", " world", "!"]

**Interview Answer**: "Tokens are the basic units of text processing in language models, affecting both performance and cost considerations."

### 13. Context Window üìè
**Simple Definition**: The maximum amount of text an AI model can consider at one time.

**Analogy**: Like a person's short-term memory - they can only focus on a limited amount of information at once.

**Practical Impact**: Determines how much conversation history or document content the AI can reference.

**Interview Answer**: "Context window defines the maximum input length an AI model can process, affecting how much information it can consider when generating responses."

## Model Types and Capabilities

### 14. Pre-trained Models üèóÔ∏è
**Simple Definition**: AI models that have already been trained on large datasets and are ready to use.

**Analogy**: Like buying a car that's already manufactured versus building one from scratch.
