## Technical Fundamentals Questions

### 1. "What is AI Engineering?"
**Framework Answer**:
"AI Engineering is the practice of building practical applications using artificial intelligence technologies. Unlike AI research which focuses on developing new algorithms, AI Engineering takes existing AI models and tools to solve real business problems.

For example, an AI Engineer might use OpenAI's GPT models to build a customer service chatbot, integrating it with a company's existing systems and ensuring it handles edge cases appropriately.

The key aspects include understanding AI capabilities and limitations, prompt engineering, API integration, and ensuring AI systems work reliably in production environments."

**Follow-up Preparation**: Be ready to discuss the difference between AI Engineering, Data Science, and ML Engineering.

### 2. "Explain the difference between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning."
**Framework Answer**:
"Think of them as nested concepts:

**AI** is the broadest field - making machines perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes everything from rule-based systems to advanced neural networks.

**Machine Learning** is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data rather than following pre-programmed rules. Like email spam detection that improves by analyzing thousands of emails.

**Deep Learning** is a subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers. It's particularly good at finding complex patterns in large datasets, like image recognition or language understanding.

As an AI Engineer, I primarily work with pre-trained models from all these areas, focusing on integration and application rather than building algorithms from scratch."

### 3. "What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?"
**Framework Answer**:
"LLMs are AI models trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. They learn statistical patterns about how words and concepts relate to each other.

For example, GPT-4 can write code, answer questions, and even engage in creative writing because it has learned patterns from diverse text sources.

In practice, we use LLMs through APIs to power applications like chatbots, content generation tools, and code assistants. The key is knowing how to prompt them effectively and handle their limitations.

Important limitations include potential hallucinations, training data cutoffs, and the need for careful prompt engineering to get consistent results."

### 4. "What is prompt engineering and why is it important?"
**Framework Answer**:
"Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective input instructions to get optimal outputs from AI models. It's crucial because the quality and format of prompts significantly impact AI performance.

For example, instead of asking 'Write an email,' a well-engineered prompt would be: 'Write a professional email declining a meeting request, maintaining a positive tone, and suggesting alternative times.'

Best practices include being specific, providing context, using examples (few-shot prompting), and iterating based on results. It's important because it can dramatically improve accuracy and reduce the need for fine-tuning expensive models."

### 5. "Explain RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)."
**Framework Answer**:
"RAG combines information retrieval with AI text generation to provide more accurate and current responses. Instead of relying only on training data, RAG first searches for relevant information, then uses that context to generate answers.

For example, a company knowledge base chatbot would:
1. Search relevant documents when asked a question
2. Retrieve the most similar content
3. Use that information as context for the AI to generate a response

This is particularly useful for accessing current information, company-specific knowledge, or reducing hallucinations. The limitation is that it's only as good as the retrieval system and the quality of the knowledge base."

## Practical Application Questions

### 6. "How would you build a customer service chatbot?"
**Framework Answer**:
"I'd approach this systematically:

**Clarify requirements**: What types of questions? Integration needs? Success metrics?

**Implementation**:
- Set up vector database with company documents
- Use OpenAI API for language understanding
- Build conversation flow management
- Integrate with existing customer service tools

**Evaluation**: Track resolution rate, customer satisfaction, escalation frequency, and response accuracy."

### 7. "A client wants to automatically categorize incoming emails. How would you approach this?"
**Framework Answer**:
"I'd start by understanding the categories and volume:

**Analysis**: What categories? How many emails daily? Current manual process?

**Solution design**:
- Use email embeddings for semantic similarity
- Implement classification using few-shot learning with LLMs
- Create confidence thresholds for automatic vs. manual review
- Design feedback loop for continuous improvement

**Implementation**: 
- Integrate with email API
- Create prompt templates for classification
- Build confidence scoring system
- Set up monitoring dashboard

**Metrics**: Classification accuracy, processing speed, manual review rate."

### 8. "How would you handle AI bias in a hiring recommendation system?"
**Framework Answer**:
"AI bias in hiring is critical to address:

**Prevention strategies**:
- Diverse, representative training data
- Remove or anonymize protected characteristics
- Test across different demographic groups
- Regular bias auditing

**Detection methods**:
- Statistical analysis of outcomes by group
- Fairness metrics (equalized odds, demographic parity)
- Regular model performance reviews
- External bias testing

**Mitigation approaches**:
- Adjust decision thresholds by group if needed
- Human-in-the-loop review for edge cases
