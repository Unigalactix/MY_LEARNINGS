# Building Your First AI App
## Hands-On Project: Customer Service Chatbot

### üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll have:
- Built a working AI chatbot from scratch
- Integrated OpenAI API with a simple web interface
- Implemented conversation memory and context
- Created a deployable application for your portfolio

## Project Overview

We'll build a customer service chatbot that can:
- Answer common questions about a fictional company
- Maintain conversation context
- Escalate complex issues to human agents
- Provide a professional web interface

### What You'll Learn
- API integration with OpenAI
- Simple web development with Streamlit
- Conversation management
- Error handling and user experience

### No Programming Experience? No Problem!
This guide assumes zero programming background. We'll explain every step and provide all the code you need.

## Setup and Prerequisites

### Step 1: Install Required Software

#### Install Python
1. Go to [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Download Python 3.8 or newer
3. Run the installer (check "Add Python to PATH")
4. Open Command Prompt/Terminal and type: `python --version`

#### Install Required Libraries
Open Command Prompt/Terminal and run these commands one by one:
```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install openai
pip install python-dotenv
```

### Step 2: Get OpenAI API Key
1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy and save it securely (you'll need this)

### Step 3: Create Project Folder
1. Create a new folder on your computer called `ai-chatbot`
2. Open this folder in a text editor (like Notepad++ or VS Code)

## Building the Chatbot

### Step 1: Create Environment File
Create a file called `.env` in your project folder and add:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### Step 2: Create Main Application File
Create a file called `app.py` with this code:

```python
import streamlit as st
import openai
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Configure OpenAI
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Page configuration
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="TechCorp Customer Service",
    page_icon="ü§ñ",
    layout="wide"
)

# Company information (customize this for your demo)
COMPANY_INFO = """

### Step 3: Test Your Application
1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal
2. Navigate to your project folder: `cd path/to/ai-chatbot`
3. Run the application: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Your browser should open with your chatbot!

## Understanding the Code

### Key Components Explained

#### 1. Environment Setup
```python
load_dotenv()
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```
This securely loads your API key from the `.env` file.

#### 2. Company Information
```python
COMPANY_INFO = """
You are a helpful customer service representative...
"""
```
This is the "system prompt" that tells the AI how to behave and what information it knows.

#### 3. AI Response Function
```python
def get_ai_response(messages):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)
```
This sends your conversation to OpenAI and gets back a response.

#### 4. User Interface
```python
st.chat_input("How can I help you today?")
```
Streamlit creates the web interface automatically.

## Customizing Your Chatbot

### Change the Company Information
Edit the `COMPANY_INFO` section to match any business:

```python
COMPANY_INFO = """
You are a customer service representative for [YOUR COMPANY NAME].

Company Information:
- We sell [YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE]
- Our prices are [YOUR PRICING]
- Contact information: [YOUR CONTACT INFO]
- Business hours: [YOUR HOURS]

[Add any specific information about your business]
"""
```

### Add More Features

#### 1. Conversation Saving
Add this function to save conversations:

```python
def save_conversation():
    """Save conversation to a file"""
    if st.session_state.messages:
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
        filename = f"conversation_{timestamp}.txt"
        
        with open(filename, "w") as f:
            for message in st.session_state.messages:
                f.write(f"{message['role']}: {message['content']}\n\n")
        
        st.success(f"Conversation saved as {filename}")
```

#### 2. Customer Satisfaction Survey
Add a feedback section:

```python
# Add to sidebar
st.header("How did we do?")
rating = st.select_slider("Rate your experience:", 
                         options=["üòû", "üòê", "üòä", "üòÑ", "ü§©"])
if st.button("Submit Feedback"):
    st.success("Thank you for your feedback!")
```

#### 3. FAQ Section
Add a collapsible FAQ:

```python
with st.expander("üìã Frequently Asked Questions"):
    st.markdown("""
    **Q: How do I reset my password?**
    A: Visit our password reset page at example.com/reset
    
    **Q: What are your support hours?**
    A: Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 6 PM EST
    
    **Q: How much does your service cost?**
    A: Our basic plan starts at $29/month per user
    """)
```

## Testing Your Chatbot

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError"
**Solution**: Make sure you installed all packages:
```bash
pip install streamlit openai python-dotenv
```

### Issue: "Authentication Error"
**Solution**: Check your API key in the `.env` file:
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Verify the key is correct from OpenAI dashboard
- Ensure the `.env` file is in the same folder as `app.py`

### Issue: "Empty Response"
**Solution**: Check your OpenAI account:
- Verify you have API credits
- Check if your API key has proper permissions
- Try using a simpler prompt

### Issue: "App Won't Start"
**Solution**: 
- Make sure Python is installed correctly
- Try running `python --version` and `streamlit --version`
- Navigate to the correct folder in terminal

## Next Level Enhancements

### 1. Add Authentication
```python
# Simple password protection
password = st.sidebar.text_input("Enter password:", type="password")
if password != "demo123":
    st.error("Please enter the correct password to continue.")
    st.stop()
```

### 2. Add Analytics
```python
# Track conversation metrics
if "conversation_count" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.conversation_count = 0

# Increment counter on new conversations
st.sidebar.metric("Conversations Today", st.session_state.conversation_count)
```

### 3. Multiple Language Support
```python
language = st.sidebar.selectbox("Language:", ["English", "Spanish", "French"])

if language == "Spanish":
    COMPANY_INFO = """
    Eres un representante de servicio al cliente para TechCorp...
    """
```
