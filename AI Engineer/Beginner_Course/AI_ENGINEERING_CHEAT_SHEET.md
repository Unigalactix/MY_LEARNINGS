## Prompt Engineering Patterns

### Basic Structure
```
[Role] + [Context] + [Task] + [Format] + [Examples]
```

### Common Patterns

#### 1. Few-Shot Learning
```
Here are some examples:
Input: "Happy customer review"
Output: "Positive"

Input: "Disappointed with service" 
Output: "Negative"

Now classify: "Amazing product, will buy again"
Output:
```

#### 2. Chain of Thought
```
Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, I need to understand...
2. Then, I should consider...
3. Finally, I can conclude...
```

#### 3. Role-Based Prompting
```
You are an expert customer service representative.
Your task is to respond to customer complaints with empathy and practical solutions.
Always maintain a professional, helpful tone.
```

## Technical Implementation

### API Integration Pattern
```python
import openai

# Basic chat completion
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ],
    max_tokens=150,
    temperature=0.7
)

# Extract response
answer = response.choices[0].message.content
```

### RAG Implementation Steps
1. **Document Processing**: Split documents into chunks
2. **Embedding Generation**: Convert chunks to vectors
3. **Vector Storage**: Store in vector database
4. **Query Processing**: Convert user question to vector
5. **Similarity Search**: Find relevant chunks
6. **Context Assembly**: Combine relevant chunks
7. **Generation**: Use context to generate answer

### Error Handling Best Practices
```python
try:
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)
except openai.error.RateLimitError:
    # Handle rate limiting
    return "Please try again in a moment"
except openai.error.InvalidRequestError:
    # Handle invalid requests
    return "Sorry, I couldn't process that request"
except Exception as e:
    # Handle other errors
    return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"
```
