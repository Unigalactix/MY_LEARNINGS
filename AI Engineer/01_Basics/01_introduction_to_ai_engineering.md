# Introduction to AI Engineering

An **AI Engineer** applies AI models to create and improve products. This role involves understanding pre-trained models, prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and building AI agents.

## Key Responsibilities

- Leveraging pre-trained models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face).
- Prompt engineering for effective model outputs.
- Implementing RAG for enhanced knowledge.
- Building AI agents for complex tasks.
- Handling multimodal AI (images, video, audio).
- Ensuring AI safety and ethics.
